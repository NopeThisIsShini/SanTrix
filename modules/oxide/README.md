# SanTrix Oxide skin tools

This project contains the default skins as well as tools and files needed to build your own skin for SanTrix.

For instructions on how to create and build skins, please refer to the SanTrix documentation (coming soon). In the meantime, the process is compatible with standard LESS-based skinning systems.

## Building the skins

The build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
2. To build the skins, run `yarn build`.
3. To view or start a dev server, run `yarn start`.
