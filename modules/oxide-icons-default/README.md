# Default icons for SanTrix

This project contains the default icons for SanTrix. Icons are loaded into the editor using an icon pack file. You can use this project as a basis for building your own icon packs. 

For instructions on how to make your own icon pack, please refer to the SanTrix documentation (coming soon).

## Building the icon pack

The icon pack build process uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Make sure you have both installed before you continue.

1. Install dependencies with `yarn`.
2. Build the icon pack using the `yarn build` command.
